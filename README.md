# Heart Failure Prediction using Machine Learning 🫀

This project uses clinical data and machine learning to predict the likelihood of death from heart failure. It includes exploratory data analysis, model training, and a Tableau dashboard for visual insights.

## 📊 About the Dataset

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, claiming ~17.9 million lives annually — 31% of all deaths. Heart failure is a critical event often resulting from CVDs.

This dataset includes **12 clinical features** from 299 patients and helps predict the occurrence of a **death event**. Features include:
- Age
- Ejection fraction
- Serum creatinine
- Diabetes, hypertension, anemia
- And others

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Train and evaluate ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Interpret feature importance
- Export predictions and build a Tableau dashboard
- Provide clinical insights through interactive visualization

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tableau**: For dashboarding and visual storytelling
- **Git/GitHub**: For version control
- *(Optional)* Jupyter Notebooks
